and then you asked yourself: "what could I do to wake up to profits like this".

If so, then SurgeTrader is for you!!!

## How it works

SurgeTrader allows you to find what market(s) has had the greatest % growth over a period of time. It presumes that the coin with the greatest % gain will go up even more in the near or distant future.

# Installation

Install python-bittrex from this github instead of PyPi.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Configuration

in the `src` directory, `bittrex.ini` should have key and secret in it like so

    [api]
    key = asdfa8asdf8asdfasdf
    secret = 99asdfn8sdfjasd

# Usage

# Earning Potential

Account balance = $1000

2% = 20

1% gain on 2% of the account = 20.20

therefore you are making 20 cents per trade

50 trades in a month = 10 dollars profit

10 dollars is 1% of 1000 -> 1% gain on the account

Therefore taking 50 2% trades and setting a 1% profit margin (ignoring fees)
