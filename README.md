# Earning Potential

Account balance = $1000

2% = 20

1% gain on 2% of the account = 20.20

therefore you are making 20 cents per trade

50 trades in a month = 10 dollars profit

10 dollars is 1% of 1000 -> 1% gain on the account

Therefore taking 50 2% trades and setting a 1% profit margin (ignoring fees)
